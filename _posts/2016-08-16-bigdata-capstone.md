This post is the result of the 6-course series of classes from the Big Data Specialization course I am currently following on [Coursera](www.coursera.org).<br>

The course is an introduction on understanding the insights that big data can provide and hands-on experience with some big data technologies.
In partnership with data software company, [Splunk](www.splunk.com), a final Capstone project is developed to apply the skills learned during the course.

This post will be a summary and findings of my capstone project, where I build a big data ecosystem to analyze and process data generated from playing an online game. Details coming soon.
