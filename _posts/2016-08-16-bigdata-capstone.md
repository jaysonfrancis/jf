subtitle: Coursera 6-course Series
---

This post is the result of the 6-course series of classes from the Big Data Specialization course I am currently following on [Coursera](http://www.coursera.org).<br>

You can find my class markdown notes and ipython hands-on examples in my github repository, [here - coursera/big-data-specialization](https://github.com/jaysonfrancis/coursera/tree/master/bigdata-specialization-ucsandiego).

The course is an introduction on understanding the insights that big data can provide and hands-on experience with a few big data technologies.
I will walk through the typical  data science steps for acquiring, exploring, preparing, analyzing & reporting with the provided dataset. 
In partnership with data software company, [Splunk](http://www.splunk.com), a final Capstone project is developed to apply the skills learned during the course.

This post will be a summary and findings of my capstone project, where I build a big data ecosystem to analyze and process data generated from playing an online game. Details coming soon.
