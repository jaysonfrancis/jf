> The Industry's Leading Analytics and Data Management Conference.
 
I decided to attend the TDWI hosted event in San Diego, CA. The event consisted of numerous classes and key-note presentations around Big Data, focusing on various aspects from Data mining, machine learning, big data, business intelligence, and more. 
 
I attended the 2-day bootcamp around the fundamentals of Data Science, which started off the week. I had the wonderful opportunity to meet with some industry leaders and professionals that work in this field to get their perspective on building a data science team and deep dive into the aspects of CRISP-DM.

Overall, the event was well organized and informational. I recommend it to anyone looking to gain insights in the fields of BI and Data science and how to derive value from data for the business.
