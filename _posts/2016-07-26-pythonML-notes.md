When I pick up a programming or research book, I usually take notes in real time of key topics, keywords and coding snipits. I was referred to _Python Machine Learning by Sebastian Raschka_ to get a deeper understanding of artificial neurons, machine learning and implementation methodologies utilizing python modules. I decided that I will be using this blog post as a source for me to reference my notes, as well as sharing them with you. 

If I decide to append in any other readings, I will note them in the future. Most of the coding snippits will be in python, and are executed with Ipython notebook, which are hosted on my github. Enjoy!
