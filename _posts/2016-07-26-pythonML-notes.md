When I pick up a programming or research book, I usually take notes in real time of key topics, keywords and coding examples for future references. 

I decided to create a [github repoistory](https://github.com/jaysonfrancis/machinelearning) of my notes and hands-on examples of various books that I begin to read.   

To start off, I was referred to _Python Machine Learning by Sebastian Raschka_ to get a deeper understanding of artificial neurons, machine learning and implementation methodologies utilizing python modules. 

### Jupyter Notebooks Examples (Python)
- [Rosenblatt's Perceptron Rule](https://github.com/jaysonfrancis/machinelearning/blob/master/src/perceptron.ipynb)  
- [Adaptive Linear Element, Adaline.](https://github.com/jaysonfrancis/machinelearning/blob/master/src/adaline.ipynb)  
- [Perceptron example with sklearn ](https://github.com/jaysonfrancis/machinelearning/blob/master/src/perceptron-sklearn.ipynb)
- [Logistic regression with sklearn ](https://github.com/jaysonfrancis/machinelearning/blob/master/src/logisticregression-sklearn.ipynb)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM) with sklearn (Coming Soon)
