When I pick up a programming or research book, I usually take notes in real time of key topics, keywords and coding snipits. I was referred to _Python Machine Learning by Sebastian Raschka_ to get a deeper understanding of articial neurons, machine learning and implementation methodologies with python modules. I decided that I will be using this blog post as a source for me to reference my notes, as well as sharing them with you. If I decide to add in any other readings, I will note themin the future. All the notes and python code are used and executed with Ipython notebook, which are linked directly to my github. Enjoy!
